#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `amount` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span><br />*BigInteger*    | 		Amount of funds to charge - in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP)|

## Signature result

`SignatureResult`

A signatureRequired event is invoked during transaction when signature verification is needed (f.ex when payment is done with a magstripe card). The merchant is required to ask the cardholder for signature and approve (or disapprove) the signature. signatureResult tells the card reader if the signature was approved by passing true in the method. To disapprove then false is passed. Integrations with PAX or Telpo devices DO NOT need the implementation of this event.

{
    //If you accept the signature
    api.SignatureResult(true);
}
```

#### Events invoked

## Tip Adjustment

`TipAdjustment`

A tip adjustment operation allows merchants to adjust the tip amount of a sale transaction before the batch of transactions is settled by the processor at the end of the day.
Note: This functionality is only available for the restaurant industry in the United States and the processors currently supporting this functionality are TSYS and VANTIV.

#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `tipAmount` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br/>*BigInteger* | Tip amount added to the original (base) transaction amount - in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP) |
| `originalTransactionID` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br/>*String*     | Unique id of the original sale transaction as received from the card reader (EFTTransactionID) |


**Code example**

```csharp
//Initiate a tip adjustment for $10.00
Task<FinancialStatus> result = hapi.TipAdjustment(BigInteger.Parse("1000"), "2bc23910-c3b3-11e6-9e62-07b2a5f091ec");
FinancialStatus status = result.Result;
if (status != FinancialStatus.FAILED)
{
	if (status == FinancialStatus.AUTHORISED)
	{
		//Success!
	}
	else
	{
		//Declined
	}
}
```

**Returns**

Result of the tip adjustment transaction, this is an asynchronous method that returns a task called `<FinancialStatus>`, the possible values are :

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **FinancialStatus**| - **FinancialStatus.AUTHORISED** (tip adjustment approved by the processor) <br />- **FinancialStatus.FAILED** (system error or timeout) <br />- **FinancialStatus.DECLINED** (tip adjustment declined by the processor)|


If two tip adjustments are sent for the same sale transaction, the second tip adjustment will override the first one. In case the transaction fails (not declined) we recommend that you prompt the user of the POS to retry the adjustment.
