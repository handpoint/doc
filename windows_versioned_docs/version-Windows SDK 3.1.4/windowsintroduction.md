# Introduction

The new generation of Handpoint APIs and SDKs are engineered to make your life simpler, happier.

**Awesomely simple**

Created for humans, coders, geeks, no need of dark and complex knowledge of the payment industry.

**Superly secure**

We take care of the PCI side so you don't have to spend months becoming compliant.
The Handpoint card reader encrypts all sensitive cardholder data so your app does not have to deal with it.
