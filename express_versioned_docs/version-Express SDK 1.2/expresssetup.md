# Setup

Download and install the app for your platform and start integrating, either directly through the custom url scheme or by using our Javascript interface that abstracts the messaging format. You can start developing as soon as you receive a Handpoint payment terminal. Your end user, the merchant, only has to install the Express application on the platform of her choice to start accepting card present payments seamlessly with your application and a Handpoint card reader.
