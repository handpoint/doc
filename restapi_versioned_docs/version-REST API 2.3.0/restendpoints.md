## Transaction Result Recovery


`TransactionResultRecovery`

 The terminal has a transaction recovery loop to automatically send back the pending TransactionResult to the callback URL in case it becomes unreachable (network issue or server down).

 For the first 100 seconds after a transaction is completed, a background thread will attempt to deliver the result every 5 seconds. If the server is still unreachable after the first 100 seconds, the retry loop turns into an exponential increment to the power of 2 (8s-16s-32s etcâ€¦).
 The recovery loop is reinitialized every time the Handpoint application is restarted or the startRecovery method is triggered. The Transaction Result received through the transaction recovery loop will have the **recoveredTransaction** field set to **true**.

 All 2XXs http response codes from the callbackUrl are valid to notify the device of a successful delivery of the result.

 **Returns**

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Transaction Result    | The [Transaction Result](restobjects.md#transaction-result-object) is delivered to the callback Url from the [Transaction Request](restobjects.md#transaction-request-object).    |
