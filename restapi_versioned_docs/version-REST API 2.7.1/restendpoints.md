# REST API Endpoints


## /initialize



`Initialize`

Initializes the REST API client and returns the list of payment terminals associated with the merchant account. We recommend that you display the list of available payment terminals to the merchant in your software. Each API key is unique per merchant and needs to be configurable in your backend. 


**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Header: ApiKeyCloud` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>    <br />*String*  | Api key used to authenticate the merchant.     |


Returns


| Devices      |
| ----------- |
| List of [Device](restobjects.md#deviceObject) object.     |


**Code Example**


```shell
Operation executed using CLI tool CURL:

REQUEST:
  curl -X GET \
   -H "ApiKeyCLoud: MeRcHaNt-ApIkEy" \
   "https://cloud.handpoint.com/initialize" (production)
   "https://cloud.handpoint.io/initialize" (development)

RESPONSE:
 Code 200 -> Body:
  [
    {
      "merchant_id_alpha": "merchantID",
      "serial_number": "082104578",
      "customerReference": "op15248",
      "terminal_type": "PAXA920"
    }
  ]
```






## /transactions



`Transactions`

POST endpoint used to send a financial operation to the payment terminal. The transaction type to be executed (sale, refund etc.) is defined in the `operation` field of the request body. 


**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Header: ApiKeyCloud` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>   <br />*String*    | Api key used to authenticate the merchant.      |
| `Request Body: Transaction Request` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>  <br />[TransactionRequest](restobjects.md#transactionRequest)    | Object containing the transaction request information.  |


**Returns**


| Response      | Response Code |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Transaction Accepted** | The response code 202 is received from the API if the transaction was successfully sent to the payment terminal.       |
| **BadRequest DeviceIsBusy Error** | The response code 400 with error 1001 is received from the API if the payment terminal is already processing a transaction.  |
| **BadRequest DeviceNotResponding Error** | The response code 400 with error 1002 is received from the API if the payment terminal is offline.     |

## /transaction-result/{transactionResultId}


`TransactionResultRetrieval`

GET endpoint used to retrieve transaction results from the payment terminal. In case you do not provide a callbackURL and token in the transaction request, the terminal will post the transaction result to an Handpoint internal API which can be queried in order for your software to fetch the transaction result. If you are running a server to receive results and pass a callback URL and token as part of the transaction request you do not need to query this endpoint.  

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Header: ApiKeyCloud` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>   <br />*String*     | Api key used to authenticate the merchant.       |
| `Path parameter: transactionResultId` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>   <br />*String*    | The transactionResultId is a unique transaction id delivered immediately as a response to your transaction request. It can be used to query for a transaction result. |


**Returns**


| Response      | Response Code |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **No Content** | Response code 204. The transactionResultId was found in the database but there is no transaction result associated yet. This status will be retrieved while the transaction is ongoing and the transaction result has not been delivered yet.     |
| **OK** | Response code 200 + Transaction Result. The transactionResultId was found in the database and the associated Transaction Result object is delivered.      |
| **Not Found** | Response code 404. The transactionResultId was not found in the database.      |

:::tip
`signatureUrl`: In case the signature can not be updated to the Handpoint servers and an URL is not generated, the terminal will send back the image binary in base64 format to your software. It is important to be able to support both the URL and the image binary format.

`customerReceipt` and `merchantReceipt`: The receipts are usually received as URLs in the transaction result from the terminal. Please note that if the terminal is not able to upload the receipt to the Handpoint cloud servers and an URL is not generated then the HTML formatted receipt will be delivered to your software. It is important to be able to manage both formats.
:::


## Transaction Result Recovery


`TransactionResultRecovery`

 The terminal has a transaction recovery loop to automatically send back the pending TransactionResult to the callback URL in case it becomes unreachable (network issue or server down).

 For the first 100 seconds after a transaction is completed, a background thread will attempt to deliver the result every 5 seconds. If the server is still unreachable after the first 100 seconds, the retry loop turns into an exponential increment to the power of 2 (8s-16s-32s etcâ€¦).
 The recovery loop is reinitialized every time the Handpoint application is restarted or the startRecovery method is triggered. The Transaction Result received through the transaction recovery loop will have the **recoveredTransaction** field set to **true**.

 All 2XXs http response codes from the callbackUrl are valid to notify the payment terminal of a successful delivery of the result.

 **Returns**

| Transaction Result      | 
| ----------- |
| The transaction result is delivered to the callback Url specified in the transaction request.   |
