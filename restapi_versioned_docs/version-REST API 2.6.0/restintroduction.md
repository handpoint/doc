Introducing the Revolutionary Handpoint REST API: Seamlessly integrate card present payments into any software

Use the Handpoint REST API to integrate leading smartpos terminals with your software. The Handpoint REST API is a simple REST interface that acts as a bridge between **your software and the payment terminal** , while shielding your software from card data. It is seamless to integrate, keeps all card data out of your system, works with every platform, and lets you use the best Android terminals on the market.

Complete your integration in just three steps: Initiate the interface, choose the terminal, and start the sale. It is as simple as it sounds. The only thing you need is a valid API key to authenticate against the API. You even get a list of terminals to which you can connect. Simply execute the financial operation, and within seconds youâ€™ll get back the transaction result and receipts in your software. The Handpoint REST API seamlessly starts and manages the entire P2PE transaction with the payment terminal, minimizing hassle for you and maximizing reliability, security, and control.
