## Sale{#2}

`Sale`

A sale initiates a payment operation to the card reader. In it's simplest form you only have to pass the amount and currency but it also accepts tip configuration and a map with extra parameters.


**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `amount` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>  <br />*BigInteger*    | Amount of funds to charge - in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP)|
| `currency` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />[*Currency*](androidobjects.md#13)     | Currency of the charge|
| `options` <br />[*SaleOptions*](androidobjects.md#4)      | An object to store all the customization options for a sale.|

**Code example**

```java
//Initiate a sale for 10.00 in Great British Pounds
api.sale(new BigInteger("1000"),Currency.GBP);

//Initiate a sale for 10.00 in Great British Pounds with a tipping configuration
//This feature is only available for PAX and Telpo devices
TipConfiguration tipConfiguration = new TipConfiguration();
tipConfiguration.setTipPercentages(Arrays.asList(5, 10, 15, 20));
tipConfiguration.setTipAmount(new BigInteger("1000"));
tipConfiguration.setBaseAmount(new BigInteger("1000"));
tipConfiguration.setEnterAmountEnabled(true);
tipConfiguration.setFooter("Thank you");
tipConfiguration.setSkipEnabled(true);
// Metadata
Metadata metadata = new Metadata("Data 1", "Data 2", "Data 3", "Data 4", "Data 5");

SaleOptions options = new SaleOptions();
options.setTipConfiguration(tipConfiguration);
options.setMetadata(metadata);

api.sale(new BigInteger("1000"),Currency.GBP, options);
```

**Events invoked**

[**currentTransactionStatus**](androideventlisteners.md#14)

## Signature result

`signatureResult`

A signatureRequired event is invoked during a transaction when a signature verification is required (f.ex when a payment is done with a swiped or chip and sign card). The merchant is required to ask the cardholder for signature and approve (or decline) the signature. signatureResult tells the card reader if the signature was approved by passing the value true in the method. To decline a signature event then false should be passed to the card reader. Note that this event is only required for an HiLite or Hi5 integration and can be safely ignored for a PAX or Telpo integration.

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `accepted` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />*Boolean*    | pass true if merchant accepts cardholder signature|

Most specifically the `transactionReference` which **must** be saved on your end in case you do not get back the transaction result object at the end of the transaction. The `transactionReference` will allow you to query the Handpoint Gateway directly to know the outcome of the transaction in case it is not delivered as planned by the terminal at the end of the transaction.|



## Tip Adjustment

`TipAdjustment`

A tip adjustment operation allows merchants to adjust the tip amount of a sale transaction before the batch of transactions is settled by the processor at the end of the day.
Note: This functionality is only available for the restaurant industry in the United States and the processors currently supporting this functionality are TSYS and VANTIV.

Dependencies:
The code example provided depends on RxJava, take a look a their documentation to see how to easily include this dependency in your android project. If you do not want to use RxJava or any additional dependencies then AsyncTask, provided by android, can be used instead for this asynchronous processing. Still we recommend using RxJava as it improves readability and maintainability.

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `tipAmount` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />*BigDecimal*     | Tip amount added to the original (base) transaction amount - in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP)|
| `originalTransactionID` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />*String*     | Unique id of the original sale transaction as received from the card reader (EFTTransactionID)|

**Code example**

```java
Observable.fromCallable(new Callable() {
	@Override
	public FinancialStatus call() throws Exception {
		return api.tipAdjustment(new BigDecimal(1000), "2bc23910-c3b3-11e6-9e62-07b2a5f091ec");
	}
})
.subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
.subscribe(new Consumer() {
	@Override
	public void accept(@NonNull FinancialStatus status) throws Exception {
		if (status == FinancialStatus.AUTHORISED) {
			//SUCCESS
		} else if (status == FinancialStatus.DECLINED) {
			//DECLINED
		} else {
			//FAILED
	}
});
```

**Returns**


Result of the tip adjustment transaction, it returns a FinancialStatus, the possible values are :

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **FinancialStatus**| - **FinancialStatus.AUTHORISED** (tip adjustment approved by the processor) <br />  - **FinancialStatus.FAILED** (system error or timeout)<br /> - **FinancialStatus.DECLINED** (tip adjustment declined by the processor).|

If two tip adjustments are sent for the same sale transaction, the second tip adjustment will override the first one. In case the transaction fails (not declined) we recommend that you prompt the user of the POS to retry the adjustment.

**Returns**

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| *[OperationStartResult](androidobjects.md#operation-start-result)*| Object containing information about the financial operation performed. Most specifically the `transactionReference` which **must** be saved on your end in case you do not get back the transaction result object at the end of the transaction. The `transactionReference` will allow you to query the Handpoint Gateway directly to know the outcome of the transaction in case it is not delivered as planned by the terminal at the end of the transaction.|


## Pre-Auth Increase

`preAuthorizationIncrease`

This operation allows the merchant to increase the amount of a previously performed pre-auth operation. For example, if a tab was opened at a restaurant and the consumer is adding new orders going above the initial pre-authorized amount, it is required to increase the amount of the initial pre-authorization before capturing it.

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `amount` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>  <br />*BigInteger*    | Amount of the pre-auth increase, in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP)|
| `currency` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />[*Currency*](androidobjects.md#13)     | Currency of the charge|
| `tipAmount`  <br />*BigInteger*     | Tip amount added to the original (base) transaction amount - in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP)|

| `preauthOptions` <br />[*Options*](androidobjects.md#7)      | An object to store merchant authentication options for pre-auth operations.|

**Code example**

```java
//Initiate a pre-auth increase for 1.00 in Great British Pounds
Options preauthOptions = new Options();
preauthOptions.setCustomerReference("CustomerReference");

api.preAuthorizationIncrease(new BigInteger("1000"),Currency.GBP,new BigInteger("100"),"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", preauthOptions);

## Pre-Auth Capture

`preAuthorizationCapture`

A pre-authorized transaction can be captured to actually debit the cardholder's account. Depending on the merchant category code, the capture needs to happen between 7 and 31 days after the original pre-authorization. If not captured the funds will be automatically released by the issuing bank.

## Pre-Auth Reversal

`preAuthorizationReversal`

A Pre-Auth reversal allows the user to reverse a previous pre-auth operation. This operation reverts (if possible) a specific pre-auth identified with a transaction id.
A pre-authorized transaction can be partially or fully released, for example when renting a car, the pre-auth reversal allows the merchant to release the funds if the car was not damaged.

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `originalTransactionID` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>  <br />*String*    |Transaction id of the original pre-auth transaction|
| `preauthOptions` <br />[*Options*](androidobjects.md#7)     | An object to store merchant authentication options for pre-auth operations.|

```java
//Initiate a pre-auth reversal
api.preAuthorizationReversal("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000");

Options preauthOptions = new Options();
preauthOptions.setCustomerReference("CustomerReference");

//Initiate a pre-auth reversal with options
api.preAuthorizationReversal("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", preauthOptions);
