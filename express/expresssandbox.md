# Sandbox

We've built a tool to help you in your development and testing of this solution. Check it at: https://handpoint.com/express

You can generate sample transactions, test the experience in your browser and see the responses if you enable the sandbox mode.

When sandbox mode is enabled you are provided with a uniqe URL which you can use for callbacks when testing your own application.
