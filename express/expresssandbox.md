# Express Sandbox

We've built a tool to help you in your development and testing of this solution. Check it at: https://handpoint.com/express. You can generate sample transactions, test the experience in your browser and see the responses from the payment terminal. When sandbox mode is enabled you are provided with a unique URL which acn be used for callbacks when testing your own application.
