# Events Listeners

## Transaction Result Recovery over CLOUD connection

`CloudTransactionResultRecovery`

The terminal has a transaction recovery loop to automatically send back the pending [*Transaction Result*](windowsobjects.md#14) to the Point of sale in case it becomes unreachable (network issue or other).
For the first 100 seconds after a transaction is completed, a background thread will attempt to deliver the result every 5 seconds. If the point of sale is still unreachable after the first 100 seconds, the retry loop turns into an exponential increment to the power of 2 (8s-16s-32s etcâ€¦).
The recovery loop is reinitialized every time the Handpoint application is restarted.The [*Transaction Result*](windowsobjects.md#14) received through the transaction recovery loop will have the recoveredTransaction field set to true.

**Important information: The point of sale must be successfully connected to a terminal in order to receive the pending transactions.**

**[*Transaction Result Ready Event*](windowsevents.md#11)**

Event containing the pending [*Transaction Result*](windowsobjects.md#14)

## Device discovery finished{#13}

`deviceDiscoveryFinished`

deviceDiscoveryFinished event gets called when a device discovery has finished and returns a list of devices.

**Subscribers Needed**

**[*AddLogEventHandler*](#20)** 

This listener has to be implemented (preferably during initialisation) in order to retrieve the card reader logs.

## Pending transaction result

`PendingTransactionResult`

In the case of a communication failure between the device and the API a TransactionResult might have not been delivered to the API. This event is invoked when the device has a pending TransactionResult. This event might be invoked when reconnecting to a device after a communication failure during a transaction. This event will not be called if HapiManager.Settings.AutoRecoverTransactionResult is set to true.

#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `device` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span><br />[*Device*](windowsobjects.md#2)     | 		The device that is invoking the event|

**Code example**

```csharp
@Override
public void PendingTransactionResult(Device device){
	//Here you might want to call api.GetPendingTransaction(); to receive the TransactionResult
}
```

**Subscribers Needed**

**[*AddPendingResultsEventHandler*](#21)** 

This listener has to be implemented (preferably during initialisation) in order to retrieve information about pending results.

## Transaction result ready{#11}

`TransactionResultReady`

In the case of a communication failure between the device and the API a TransactionResult might have not been delivered to the API. This event will be invoked after using hapi.GetPendingTransaction();. When there is no pending transaction the TransactionResult will contain default/error fields and no receipts. This event is called if HapiManager.Settings.AutoRecoverTransactionResult is set to true.

#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Notes |

	//Here you might want to do stuff to the transactionResult
}
```

**Subscribers Needed**

**AddPendingResultsEventHandler** 

This listener has to be implemented (preferably during initialisation) in order to retrieve information about pending results.
