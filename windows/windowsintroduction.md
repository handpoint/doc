The new generation of Handpoint APIs and SDKs are engineered to make your life simpler, happier.

**Awesomely simple**

Created for humans, coders, geeks, no need of dark and complex knowledge of the payment industry.

**Superly secure**

We take care of the PCI side so you don't have to spend months becoming compliant.
The Handpoint card reader encrypts all sensitive cardholder data so your app does not have to deal with it.

**Working with the SDK**

The Handpoint Windows SDK is compatible with .NET Framework Version 4.6.1.

1. Download the SDK.
2. Create a new windows form project in Visual Studio 2010 (or above) using .Net Framework Version 4.6.1.
3. Add the [HandpointSDK NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HandpointSDK/) to your project.
If you have a DEBUG device [(How to identify DEBUG devices)](https://handpoint.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PD/pages/1578401793/How+to+Identify+Between+Development+and+Production+Terminals) please use the package version -beta (prerelease): Example 3.0.0-beta
4. Follow the getting started guide, to get you up and running or dive into the documentation.
