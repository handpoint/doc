## Print Receipt

Print on demand functionality allowing the merchant to print any HTML formatted receipt. It is possible to print images or barcodes as well as passing directly a URL to the printReceipt function. A bitmap can also be printed, in order to do so it needs to be rendered as an image and inserted into the html.

:::tip
The receipts are usually received as URLs in the transaction result from the terminal but note that if the terminal is not able to upload the receipt to the Handpoint cloud servers and generate a URL then the HTML formatted receipt will be delivered to your software. It is important to be able to manage both formats. 
:::

#### Parameters

| ----------- | ----------- |
| `receipt` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span><br />*String*     | 		HTML receipt or url to locate the receipt, it can be found in the response of a financial operation, in the fields merchantReceipt or customerReceipt.

**Code example**

```csharp
// string validReceipt = '...';
bool success = api.PrintReceipt(validReceipt);
```

**Returns**

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Boolean`| `true` if the receipt was sent to the printer, false otherwise|


## Signature Result

`SignatureResult` <span class="badge badge--info">Method</span>

A signatureRequired event is invoked during a transaction when a signature verification is required, for example when a payment is done with a swiped or chip and signature card. The merchant is required to ask the cardholder for signature and approve (or decline) the transaction. signatureResult tells the payment terminal if the signature was approved by passing the value true in the method. To decline a signature event then false should be passed to the payment terminal. Note that this event is only required for an HiLite integration and can be safely ignored for a PAX or Telpo integration.

#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `accepted` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span><br />*Boolean*     | 		pass true if merchant accepts customer signature|

{
    //If you accept the signature
    api.SignatureResult(true);
}
```

#### Events invoked

**[*currentTransactionStatus*](windowsevents.md#4)**

****

**[*endOfTransaction*](windowsevents.md#6)**

This event is invoked when the transaction is completed, it contains the transaction result and receipts. 
****

**Returns**

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Boolean`| `true` if the operation was successfully sent to the payment terminal|



## Tip Adjustment

`TipAdjustment` <span class="badge badge--info">Method</span>

A tip adjustment operation allows merchants to adjust the tip amount of a sale transaction before the batch of transactions is settled by the processor at the end of the day.
Note: This functionality is only available for the restaurant industry in the United States and the processors currently supporting this functionality are TSYS and VANTIV. This functionality is limited to HiLite terminals.

#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `tipAmount` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br/>*BigInteger* | Tip amount added to the original (base) transaction amount - in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP). |
| `originalTransactionID` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br/>*String*     | Id of the original sale transaction (EFTTransactionID) |


**Code example**

```csharp
//Initiate a tip adjustment for $10.00
Task<FinancialStatus> result = hapi.TipAdjustment(BigInteger.Parse("1000"), "2bc23910-c3b3-11e6-9e62-07b2a5f091ec");
FinancialStatus status = result.Result;
if (status != FinancialStatus.FAILED)
{
	if (status == FinancialStatus.AUTHORISED)
	{
		//Success!
	}
	else
	{
		//Declined
	}
}
```

**Returns**

Result of the tip adjustment transaction, this is an asynchronous method that returns a task called `<FinancialStatus>`, the possible values are :

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **FinancialStatus**| - **FinancialStatus.AUTHORISED** (tip adjustment approved by the processor) <br />- **FinancialStatus.FAILED** (system error or timeout) <br />- **FinancialStatus.DECLINED** (tip adjustment declined by the processor)|


If two tip adjustments are sent for the same sale transaction, the second tip adjustment will override the first one. In case the transaction fails (not declined) we recommend that you prompt the user of the POS to retry the adjustment.

## Tokenize Card

`TokenizeCard` <span class="badge badge--info">Method</span>

Returns a card token (representing the card number). This functionality is not available for all acquirers, please check with Handpoint to know if tokenization is supported for your acquirer of choice.
