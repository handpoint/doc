| ----------- | ----------- |
| `amount` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span><br />*BigInteger*    | 		Transaction amount - in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP).|
| `currency` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span><br />[*Currency*](windowsobjects.md#1)     | 		Currency of the transaction.|
| `map` <br />*Map*     | 		A map including [*optional transaction parameters.*](windowsobjects.md#3)|


**Code example**

```csharp
// Basic
this.Hapi.Sale(new BigInteger("1000"), Currency.EUR);

// With options
Dictionary map = new Dictionary();
map.Add(XmlTag.CustomerReference.Tag(), "YourCustomerReference");
map.Add(XmlTag.Metadata1.Tag(), "Data 1");

this.Hapi.Sale(new BigInteger("1000"), Currency.EUR, map);
```

#### Events invoked

**[*currentTransactionStatus*](windowsevents.md#4)** 

This event gets statuses from the payment terminal during the transaction, for example: 'waiting for card' or 'waiting for PIN entry'

## Print Receipt

`PrintReceipt` <span class="badge badge--info">Method</span>

Print on demand functionality allowing the merchant to print any HTML formatted receipt. It is possible to print images or barcodes as well as passing directly a URL to the printReceipt function. A bitmap can also be printed, in order to do so it needs to be rendered as an image and inserted into the html.

:::tip
The receipts are usually received as URLs in the transaction result from the terminal but note that if the terminal is not able to upload the receipt to the Handpoint cloud servers and generate a URL then the HTML formatted receipt will be delivered to your software. It is important to be able to manage both formats. 
:::

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Boolean`| `true` if the receipt was sent to the printer, false otherwise|


## Signature Result

`SignatureResult` <span class="badge badge--info">Method</span>

A signatureRequired event is invoked during a transaction when a signature verification is required, for example when a payment is done with a swiped or chip and signature card. The merchant is required to ask the cardholder for signature and approve (or decline) the transaction. signatureResult tells the payment terminal if the signature was approved by passing the value true in the method. To decline a signature event then false should be passed to the payment terminal. Note that this event is only required for an HiLite integration and can be safely ignored for a PAX or Telpo integration.

#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `accepted` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span><br />*Boolean*     | 		pass true if merchant accepts customer signature|

Note: This functionality is only available for the restaurant industry in the United States and the processors currently supporting this functionality are TSYS and VANTIV. This functionality is limited to HiLite terminals.

#### Parameters

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `originalTransactionID` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br/>*String*     | Id of the original sale transaction (EFTTransactionID) |

//Initiate a tip adjustment for $10.00
Task<FinancialStatus> result = hapi.TipAdjustment(BigInteger.Parse("1000"), "2bc23910-c3b3-11e6-9e62-07b2a5f091ec");
FinancialStatus status = result.Result;
if (status != FinancialStatus.FAILED)
{
	if (status == FinancialStatus.AUTHORISED)
	{
		//Success!
	}
	else
	{
		//Declined
	}
}
```

**Returns**

Result of the tip adjustment transaction, this is an asynchronous method that returns a task called `<FinancialStatus>`, the possible values are :

| Parameter      | Notes |

## Pre-Auth

`preAuthorization`

A pre-auth initiates a pre-authorization operation to the card reader. In it's simplest form you only have to pass the amount and currency but it also accepts tip configuration and a map with extra parameters.

## Pre-Auth Increase

`preAuthorizationIncrease`

This operation allows the merchant to increase the amount of a previously performed pre-auth operation.

| ----------- | ----------- |
| *[OperationStartResult](windowsobjects.md#OperationStartResul)*| Object containing information about the financial operation performed. Most specifically the `transactionReference` which **must** be saved on your end in case you do not get back the transaction result object at the end of the transaction.

## Pre-Auth Capture

`preAuthorizationCapture`

A pre-authorized transaction can be captured to actually debit the cardholder's account. Depending on the merchant category code, the capture needs to happen between 7 and 31 days after the original pre-authorization. If not captured the funds will be automatically released by the issuing bank.


Card schemes set specific rules around which businesses are able to use pre-auth transactions. Eligibility is determined based on the Merchant Category Code (MCC), together with the card scheme.

Card schemes have their own set of rules on authorisation expiry. Capturing a transaction after the scheme expiry time increases the risk of a failed capture, and may also increase the interchange and/or scheme fees charged for the transaction. Card schemes can also expire an authorisation before or after the official scheme expiry period has been reached. You can often capture a payment successfully after an authorisation has expired. Depending on the card scheme, there can be a fee for late capture, and an increase in interchange fee. The risk of cardholder chargebacks increase as well.

## Pre-Auth Reversal

`preAuthorizationReversal`

A Pre-Auth reversal allows the user to reverse a previous pre-auth operation. This operation reverts (if possible) a specific pre-auth identified with a transaction id.
A pre-authorized transaction can be fully released, for example when renting a car, the pre-auth reversal allows the merchant to release the funds if the car was not damaged.

A Pre-Auth reversal can be used to reverse a capture operation as well. When the capture operation is reversed, the withheld funds are released. Reversing a capture operation can only be done before the funds are automatically settled at night. If a capture reversal is attempted after the funds have been moved, the operation will receive a decline.<br /><br />When the capture is reverted it returns to the previous state ([CAPTURED](windowsobjects.md#25) -> [AUTHORISED](windowsobjects.md#25)).

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `originalTransactionID` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>  <br />*String*    |Transaction id of the original pre-auth or capture GUID transaction|
| `map` <br />*Map* | A map including [*optional transaction parameters.*](windowsobjects.md#3)|

**Code example**

```csharp
// Basic
this.Hapi.PreAuthorizationReversal("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000");
