## Sale{#2}

`Sale`

A sale initiates a payment operation to the card reader. In it's simplest form you only have to pass the amount and currency but it also accepts tip configuration and a map with extra parameters.


**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `amount` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>  <br />*BigInteger*    | Amount of funds to charge - in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP)|
| `currency` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />[*Currency*](androidobjects.md#13)     | Currency of the charge|
| `options` <br />[*SaleOptions*](androidobjects.md#4)      | An object to store all the customization options for a sale ([Tip Configuration](androidobjects.md#39), [Metadata](androidobjects.md#metadata), [Money Remittance Options](androidobjects.md#money-remittance-options),...)|

**Code example**

```java
//Initiate a sale for 10.00 in Great British Pounds
api.sale(new BigInteger("1000"),Currency.GBP);

//Initiate a sale for 10.00 in Great British Pounds with a tipping configuration
//This feature is only available for PAX and Telpo devices
TipConfiguration tipConfiguration = new TipConfiguration();
tipConfiguration.setTipPercentages(Arrays.asList(5, 10, 15, 20));
tipConfiguration.setTipAmount(new BigInteger("1000"));
tipConfiguration.setBaseAmount(new BigInteger("1000"));
tipConfiguration.setEnterAmountEnabled(true);
tipConfiguration.setFooter("Thank you");
tipConfiguration.setSkipEnabled(true);
// Metadata
Metadata metadata = new Metadata("Data 1", "Data 2", "Data 3", "Data 4", "Data 5");

SaleOptions options = new SaleOptions();
options.setTipConfiguration(tipConfiguration);
options.setMetadata(metadata);

api.sale(new BigInteger("1000"),Currency.GBP, options);

## Signature result

`signatureResult`

A signatureRequired event is invoked during a transaction when a signature verification is required (f.ex when a payment is done with a swiped or chip and sign card). The merchant is required to ask the cardholder for signature and approve (or decline) the signature. signatureResult tells the card reader if the signature was approved by passing the value true in the method. To decline a signature event then false should be passed to the card reader. Note that this event is only required for an HiLite or Hi5 integration and can be safely ignored for a PAX or Telpo integration.

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `accepted` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />*Boolean*    | pass true if merchant accepts cardholder signature|

The `transactionReference` will allow you to query the Handpoint Gateway directly to know the outcome of the transaction in case it is not delivered as planned by the terminal at the end of the transaction.|





## Tip Adjustment

`TipAdjustment`

A tip adjustment operation allows merchants to adjust the tip amount of a sale transaction before the batch of transactions is settled by the processor at the end of the day.
Note: This functionality is only available for the restaurant industry in the United States and the processors currently supporting this functionality are TSYS and VANTIV.

If you do not want to use RxJava or any additional dependencies then AsyncTask, provided by android, can be used instead for this asynchronous processing. Still we recommend using RxJava as it improves readability and maintainability.

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `tipAmount` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />*BigDecimal*     | Tip amount added to the original (base) transaction amount - in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP)|
| `originalTransactionID` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />*String*     | Unique id of the original sale transaction as received from the card reader (EFTTransactionID)|

**Code example**

```java
Observable.fromCallable(new Callable() {
	@Override
	public FinancialStatus call() throws Exception {
		return api.tipAdjustment(new BigDecimal(1000), "2bc23910-c3b3-11e6-9e62-07b2a5f091ec");
	}
})
.subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
.subscribe(new Consumer() {
	@Override
	public void accept(@NonNull FinancialStatus status) throws Exception {
		if (status == FinancialStatus.AUTHORISED) {
			//SUCCESS
		} else if (status == FinancialStatus.DECLINED) {
			//DECLINED
		} else {
			//FAILED
	}
});
```

**Returns**


Result of the tip adjustment transaction, it returns a FinancialStatus, the possible values are :

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **FinancialStatus**| - **FinancialStatus.AUTHORISED** (tip adjustment approved by the processor) <br />  - **FinancialStatus.FAILED** (system error or timeout)<br /> - **FinancialStatus.DECLINED** (tip adjustment declined by the processor).|

If two tip adjustments are sent for the same sale transaction, the second tip adjustment will override the first one. In case the transaction fails (not declined) we recommend that you prompt the user of the POS to retry the adjustment.

## Tokenize Card{#12}

`tokenizeCard`

Returns a card token (not available for all acquirers, please check with Handpoint to know if tokenization is supported for your acquirer of choice)

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `options` <br />[*SaleOptions*](androidobjects.md#4)     | An object to store all the customization options for the transaction.|

**Code example**

```java
//Tokenize a card
api.tokenizeCard();
```

**Events invoked**

[**currentTransactionStatus**](androideventlisteners.md#14)

Invoked during a transaction, it fetches statuses coming from the terminal (ex : 'waiting for card' or 'waiting for PIN entry').
***

[**endOfTransaction**](androideventlisteners.md#16)

Invoked when the terminal finishes processing the transaction.
***

**Returns**

Most specifically the `transactionReference` which **must** be saved on your end in case you do not get back the transaction result object at the end of the transaction. The `transactionReference` will allow you to query the Handpoint Gateway directly to know the outcome of the transaction in case it is not delivered as planned by the terminal at the end of the transaction.|


## Card PAN{#13}

`cardPan`

A cardPan request will return the full PAN of the card being swiped, dipped or tapped. Only the PANs of whitelisted card ranges will be returned by the Handpoint systems. This operation is mostly used to be able to process funds or points from loyalty cards.

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `options` <br />[*SaleOptions*](androidobjects.md#4)     | An object to store all the customization options for the transaction.|

The `transactionReference` will allow you to query the Handpoint Gateway directly to know the outcome of the transaction in case it is not delivered as planned by the terminal at the end of the transaction.|




## Pre-Auth

`preAuthorization`

A pre-auth initiates a pre-authorization operation to the card reader. In it's simplest form you only have to pass the amount and currency but it also accepts tip configuration and a map with extra parameters.
A pre-authorization charge, also known as a pre-auth or authorization hold, is a temporary hold placed on a customer's payment card. It's used to verify that the account is valid and has sufficient funds to cover a pending transaction, without actually debiting the cardholder's account upfront.

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `amount` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>  <br />*BigInteger*    | Amount of funds to pre-auth - in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP)|
| `currency` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />[*Currency*](androidobjects.md#13)     | Currency of the charge|

Invoked when the terminal finishes processing the transaction.
***

**Returns**

| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| *[OperationStartResult](androidobjects.md#operation-start-result)*| Object containing information about the financial operation performed. Most specifically the `transactionReference` which **must** be saved on your end in case you do not get back the transaction result object at the end of the transaction. The `transactionReference` will allow you to query the Handpoint Gateway directly to know the outcome of the transaction in case it is not delivered as planned by the terminal at the end of the transaction.|


## Pre-Auth Increase/Decrease

`preAuthorizationIncrease`

This operation allows the merchant to increase/decrease the amount of a previously performed pre-auth operation. For example, if a tab was opened at a restaurant and the consumer is adding new orders going above the initial pre-authorized amount, it is required to increase the amount of the initial pre-authorization before capturing it. If the merchant wants to release part of a pre-auth, an increase with **negative** amount should be passed to the function.

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `amount` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>  <br />*BigInteger*    | Amount of the pre-auth increase, in the minor unit of currency (f.ex. 1000 is 10.00 GBP)|
| `currency` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />[*Currency*](androidobjects.md#13)     | Currency of the charge|
| `originalTransactionID` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span> <br />*String*  | Transaction ID of the original pre-auth operation|
| `preauthOptions` <br />[*Options*](androidobjects.md#7)      | An object to store merchant authentication options for pre-auth operations.|

**Code example**

```java
//Initiate a pre-auth increase for 1.00 in Great British Pounds
Options preauthOptions = new Options();
preauthOptions.setCustomerReference("CustomerReference");

api.preAuthorizationIncrease(new BigInteger("100"),Currency.GBP,"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", preauthOptions);

//Initiate a pre-auth decrease for 1.00 in Great British Pounds
Options preauthOptions = new Options();
preauthOptions.setCustomerReference("CustomerReference");

api.preAuthorizationIncrease(new BigInteger("-100"),Currency.GBP,"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", preauthOptions);
```

**Events invoked**

| ----------- | ----------- |
| *[OperationStartResult](androidobjects.md#operation-start-result)*| Object containing information about the financial operation performed. Most specifically the `transactionReference` which **must** be saved on your end in case you do not get back the transaction result object at the end of the transaction. The `transactionReference` will allow you to query the Handpoint Gateway directly to know the outcome of the transaction in case it is not delivered as planned by the terminal at the end of the transaction.|


## Pre-Auth Capture

`preAuthorizationCapture`

A pre-authorized transaction can be captured to actually debit the cardholder's account. Depending on the merchant category code, the capture needs to happen between 7 and 31 days after the original pre-authorization. If not captured the funds will be automatically released by the issuing bank.

**Please note that a pre-authorization can only be captured ONCE, multiple partial captures are not allowed**. If for some reason, the pre-authorization was captured for an incorrect amount, you can attempt to reverse the capture (does not work with all acquirers). If the capture reversal was declined, the cardholder needs to come back into the store with his card to get refunded or re-authorize the transaction. Alternatively, the cardholder can give his card details over the phone to the merchant and a MOTO pre-auth or MOTO refund can be issued.  

Card schemes set specific rules around which businesses are able to use pre-auth transactions. Eligibility is determined based on the Merchant Category Code (MCC), together with the card scheme.

Card schemes have their own set of rules on authorisation expiry. Capturing a transaction after the scheme expiry time increases the risk of a failed capture, and may also increase the interchange and/or scheme fees charged for the transaction. Card schemes can also expire an authorisation before or after the official scheme expiry period has been reached. You can often capture a payment successfully after an authorisation has expired. Depending on the card scheme, there can be a fee for late capture, and an increase in interchange fee. The risk of cardholder chargebacks increase as well.

## Pre-Auth/Capture Reversal

`preAuthorizationReversal`

A Pre-Auth reversal allows the user to reverse a previous pre-auth operation. This operation reverts (if possible) a specific pre-auth identified with a transaction id.
A pre-authorized reversal transaction **will release the whole pre-authorized amount**, for example when renting a car, the pre-auth reversal allows the merchant to release the funds if the car was not damaged. For partial releases, please check the [Pre-Auth Increase/Decrease](androidtransactions.md#pre-auth-increasedecrease) operation.

A Pre-Auth reversal can be used to reverse a capture operation as well. A capture reversal transaction **will release all the funds withheld**. Reversing a capture operation can only be done before the funds are automatically settled at night, please note that not all acquirers support reversal of captured transactions. If a capture reversal is attempted after the funds have been moved, the operation will receive a decline.<br /><br />When the capture is reverted it returns to the previous state ([CAPTURED](androidobjects.md#34) -> [AUTHORISED](androidobjects.md#34)).

**Parameters**


| Parameter      | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `originalTransactionID` <span class="badge badge--primary">Required</span>  <br />*String*    |Transaction id of the original pre-auth or capture GUID transaction.|
| `preauthOptions` <br />[*Options*](androidobjects.md#7)     | An object to store merchant authentication options for pre-auth operations.|

Options preauthOptions = new Options();
preauthOptions.setCustomerReference("CustomerReference");

//Initiate a pre-auth reversal with options

## Standalone Tokenized Payments Operations (Tokenize and Modify)

`standaloneTokenizedPaymentsOperations`

### Standalone Tokenized Sale

** Overview **

The **`tokenizedOperation`** functionality in the Handpoint Android SDK enables card tokenization followed by a sale transaction. It is executed through the `Hapi` Android interface.

This operation consists of two stages:

1. **Card Tokenization**: The SDK tokenizes the card and triggers the **`Events.CardTokenized` event**, providing the tokenized card details and control callbacks.
2. **Sale Execution**: The integrator must invoke the `resume()` method from the callback object to proceed with the sale transaction. The outcome is returned through the **`Events.EndOfTransaction` event**.

---

** Method Signature **

```kotlin
/**
 * Tokenized Operation on a specific device using regular parameters.
 * This operation consists of two parts. The first part, performs a tokenization of the card,
 * whose token is sent to the integrator through the Events.CardTokenized event.
 * Once the integrator wishes to continue the operation,
 * it must execute the resume method of the object sent through the event,
 * with the data of the operation it wishes to perform.
 * This operation will be executed and
 * the result will be received through the Events.EndOfTransaction event.
 * The operation supported is Sale.
 *
 * @param amount   The transaction amount.
 * @param currency The currency to be used.
 * @param options  An object containing configuration parameters for customer reference.
 * @return True if the command was sent successfully to the device. False if sending failed.
 */
@JvmOverloads
fun tokenizedOperation(amount: BigInteger, currency: Currency, options: Options = Options()): OperationStartResult
```

---

** Events Flow **

*** 1. `Events.CardTokenized` ***

Triggered after the card is tokenized. Provides:

- **`CardTokenizationData`**: Contains tokenized card information.
- **`ResumeCallback`**: Allows the integrator to resume, cancel, or finish the operation.

*** 2. `Events.EndOfTransaction` ***

Triggered after the sale transaction is completed, returning the transaction result.

| `SaleReversal`         | `amount: BigInteger`, `currency: Currency`, `originalTransactionID: String`, `options: SaleReversalOptions`                                                      | Reverses a previous sale. *(Not allowed after tokenization)* |
| `RefundReversal`       | `amount: BigInteger`, `currency: Currency`, `originalTransactionID: String`, `options: RefundReversalOptions`                                                    | Reverses a previous refund. *(Not allowed after tokenization)* |

---

** Behavior and Restrictions **

- **Only `Sale` operations are allowed** when invoking `resume()` after receiving the `cardTokenized` event.
  - Passing other operation types (`Refund`, `SaleReversal`, `RefundReversal`) will result in a transaction result with **`MessageType.FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED`**.

- Proper exception handling is required when using the `ResumeCallback` methods.

---

** Exceptions **

| Exception               | Description                                                                    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ResumedOperation`      | Thrown if the operation was already resumed.                                   |
| `CancelledOperation`    | Thrown if the operation was previously cancelled.                              |
| `TimeoutOperation`      | Thrown if the operation timed out.                                             |
| `IllegalStateException` | Thrown for any invalid operation state.                                        |

** Sequence Diagram **

[![Standalone Tokenized SALE Sequence Diagram](/img/standalone_tokenized_SALE.png)](/img/standalone_tokenized_SALE.png)
---

** Summary **

The **`tokenizedOperation`** method securely tokenizes card data and passes control to the integrator via the **`Events.CardTokenized` event**, delivering:

1. **`CardTokenizationData`**: Contains the tokenized card details.
2. **`ResumeCallback`**: Allows integrators to resume with a supported `Sale` operation, cancel, or finish without a transaction.

The result of the operation is returned through the **`Events.EndOfTransaction` event**.

> **Tip:** Always validate and handle exceptions when interacting with `ResumeCallback` to ensure smooth operation flow.

### Standalone Tokenized Refund, Reversal and RefundReversal

`standaloneTokenizedRefund`

** Overview **

The **`tokenizedOperation`** functionality in the Handpoint Android SDK allows the execution of a card tokenization followed immediately by a specified operation (such as SaleReversal, Refund, or RefundReversal). 

In this version, the integrator provides the required operation as a parameter, and the SDK performs:

1. Card Tokenization (with a REST API request to retrieve the card token).
2. Execution of the operation passed by the integrator.

The result of both actions is delivered through the **`Events.EndOfTransaction` event**.

---

** Method Signature **

```kotlin
/**
 * Tokenized Operation on a specific device using regular parameters.
 * This operation consists of the consecutive execution of two operations:
 * Tokenization of the card and the operation passed by parameter by
 * the integrator. The result of both operations will be received through
 * the Events.EndOfTransaction event.
 * The operations supported are: SaleReversal, Refund, RefundReversal
 *
 * @param currency  The currency to be used.
 * @param operation The operation to be executed.
 * @param options   An object containing configuration parameters for customer reference.
 * @return True if the command was sent successfully to the device. False if the sending was not successful.
 */
fun tokenizedOperation(
	currency: Currency,
	operation: OperationDto,
	options: Options = Options()
): OperationStartResult
```

---

** Events Flow **

*** Events.EndOfTransaction ***

Triggered after both card tokenization and the specified operation are executed. The integrator receives the final transaction result in this event.

---

** Supported Operations **

This version of `tokenizedOperation` supports the following **OperationDto** types:

| OperationDto Subclass    | Fields                                                                                                                                                        | Description                                               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Refund`                 | `amount: BigInteger`, `currency: Currency`, `originalTransactionID: String?`, `options: RefundOptions`                                                           | Initiates a refund transaction.                           |
| `SaleReversal`           | `amount: BigInteger`, `currency: Currency`, `originalTransactionID: String`, `options: SaleReversalOptions`                                                      | Reverses a previous sale.                                 |
| `RefundReversal`         | `amount: BigInteger`, `currency: Currency`, `originalTransactionID: String`, `options: RefundReversalOptions`                                                    | Reverses a previous refund.                               |

> **Note:**  
> `Sale` operation is **not supported** in this version of `tokenizedOperation`.

---

** Tokenization Process **

Internally, the SDK performs a REST API call to retrieve the card token. Once retrieved, it immediately proceeds to execute the operation provided by the integrator.

---

*** Example Usage (Kotlin) ***

```kotlin
val refundOperation = OperationDto.Refund(
	amount = BigInteger.valueOf(1500),
	currency = Currency.getInstance("EUR"),
	originalTransactionID = "TX123456",
	options = RefundOptions(/* options */)
)

val result = hapi.tokenizedOperation(
	currency = Currency.getInstance("EUR"),
	operation = refundOperation,
	options = Options(/* config */)
)
```

---

** Behavior and Restrictions **

- The SDK will **automatically execute** both:
  1. Tokenization (via REST API).
  2. The provided operation (`Refund`, `SaleReversal`, or `RefundReversal`).

- The integrator will receive the outcome via **`Events.EndOfTransaction`**.

- Sale operations are **not allowed** in this mode.

---

** Exceptions **

The method itself returns `false` if the command fails to send to the device. Other exceptions related to transaction processing will be communicated via the **`Events.EndOfTransaction`** event.

---

** Sequence Diagram **

[![Standalone Tokenized Refund, Reversal and RefundReversal Sequence Diagram](/img/standalone_Tokenized_Refund_and_reversals.png)](/img/standalone_Tokenized_Refund_and_reversals.png)

---

** Summary **

The **`tokenizedOperation`** method allows integrators to provide a specific operation upfront (Refund, SaleReversal, RefundReversal). The SDK:

1. Retrieves the card token via REST API.
2. Immediately executes the operation.
3. Returns the result via **`Events.EndOfTransaction`**.

> **Tip:** Use this method when you want to perform tokenization and the operation in one streamlined flow, without intermediate decision points.

## Cloud Tokenized Payments Operations

`cloudTokenizedPaymentsOperations`

** Overview **

In Cloud mode, integrators can control the Android SDK via one of our Cloud clients, which are our [REST API](/restapi/restintroduction), [JavaScript SDK](/javascript/javascriptintroduction) and [Windows SDK](/windows/windowsintroduction).

There are two possible types of Cloud integrations:

- **Integration with a callback URL**
- **Integration with Polling**

---

**Integration with a callback URL**

If a `callbackUrl` and a `token` are included in the request, the terminal sends a POST with the transaction result to the specified URL. The token will be included in the HTTP header as `AUTH-TOKEN` and can be used on the callback URL side to identify or authenticate the call.

***Example:***

*Request:*

```bash
curl -X POST -H"ApiKeyCloud: XXXXXXX-KXDMZV1-HW8MXBG-XXXXXXX" -H"Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"operation": "sale", "terminal_type":"PAXA910S", "serial_number": "2840011110", "amount": "1034", "currency": "EUR", "tokenize": true, "callbackUrl": "https://results.example.com/callback", "token": "auth-token-1" }' \
https://cloud.handpoint.io/transactions
```
*Response:*
```json
{"statusMessage":"Operation Accepted"}
```

*Callback:*

The following is an example of the transaction result sent to the specified `callbackUrl`:
```json

   "tipPercentage": 0.0,
   "recoveredTransaction": false
}
```

**Integration using Polling**

If the request does not include a `callbackUrl` and a `token`, then polling can be used to retrieve the transaction result from Handpoint's transaction-result endpoint.

***Example:***

*Request:*

```bash
curl -X POST -H"ApiKeyCloud: XXXXXXX-KXDMZV1-HW8MXBG-XXXXXXX" -H"Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"operation": "sale", "terminal_type":"PAXA910S", "serial_number": "2840011110", "amount": "1034", "currency": "EUR", "tokenize": true }' \
https://cloud.handpoint.io/transactions
```

*Response:*

Using the `transactionResultId`, integrators can poll the transaction-result endpoint to retrieve the result:

```json
{
  "statusMessage": "Operation Accepted",
  "transactionResultId": "1840011114-1735048331833"
}
```

*Polling request:*

```bash
curl -i -X GET -H"ApiKeyCloud: XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX" -H"Content-Type: application/json" \
https://cloud.handpoint.io/transaction-result/1840011114-1735048331833
```

*Possible responses from polling:*

- 204: Transaction still in process.
- 200: Transaction result is available.

### Cloud Tokenized Sale

**Overview**

The **Cloud Tokenized Operation** enables remote-triggered financial operations, where a cloud-based system initiates a request to tokenize a card and perform a **Sale** transaction using the Android SDK.

This operation is initiated by sending a **`CloudFinancialRequest`** object. The SDK handles the following workflow:

1. Parses and validates the `CloudFinancialRequest`.
2. Tokenizes the card (if `tokenize` is `true` and `operation` is `Sale`).
3. Triggers the **`Events.CardTokenized`** event with token and callback.
4. Proceeds with the Sale operation upon `resume()` call.
5. Emits the final result via **`Events.EndOfTransaction`**.

---

**CloudFinancialRequest**

**Description**

A data object that represents the request payload for initiating cloud-based financial operations including tokenized sales.

**Key Fields**

| Field                    | Type                              | Description |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| `operation`              | `Operations`                      | Must be set to `Operations.Sale` for this flow. |
| `tokenize`             | `Boolean`                         | Must be set to `true` to trigger card tokenization. |
| `amount`                 | `String?`                         | Transaction amount as string. |
| `currency`               | `String?`                         | Currency code. |
| `callbackUrl`            | `String?`                         | If present, indicates REST API request. |
| `originalTransactionId` | `String`                          | Identifier of original transaction (if any). |
| `uuid`                   | `String`                          | Event UUID, auto-formatted as 6-digit string. |
| `transactionReference`   | `String`                          | Reference for idempotency; auto-generated if blank. |
| `receipt`                | `String?`                         | Raw or URL-based receipt data. |
| `metadata`               | `Metadata?`                       | Optional metadata for the operation. |
| `merchantAuth`           | `MerchantAuth?`                   | Merchant authentication object. |
| `duplicateCheck`         | `Boolean`                         | Enables duplicate request validation. |
| `duplicateCheckEndpoint`| `String`                          | Optional custom endpoint for duplicate checks. |

> **Note:** Other fields may be present but are not required for the tokenized Sale flow.

---

**Internal Behavior**

- The SDK uses `getParsedAmount()` and `getParsedCurrency()` to convert string values into typed `BigInteger` and `Currency`.
- If `callbackUrl` is present, the request is treated as a REST API request.
- If `tokenize` is `true` and `operation == Sale`, the card is tokenized, and the **`Events.CardTokenized`** event is emitted.
- After receiving the `resume()` call, the SDK performs the Sale operation.

---

**Events Flow**

1. `Events.CardTokenized`

Emitted after card tokenization. Provides:
- `CardTokenizationData`: Includes card token and card info.
- `ResumeCallback`: To resume with the `Sale` operation.

2. `Events.EndOfTransaction`

Emitted after the sale is completed.

---

**Behavior and Restrictions**

- The only supported operation for this flow is **Sale**.
- Must set:
  - `operation = Operations.Sale`
  - `tokenize = true`
- Invoking `resume()` with any operation other than `Sale` will result in `MessageType.FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED`.

---

**Example CloudFinancialRequest JSON**

```json
{
  "operation": "Sale",
  "tokenize": true,
  "amount": "1000",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "transactionReference": "a1b2c3d4",
  "callbackUrl": "https://merchant.com/callback"
}
```

---

**Example Kotlin Flow**

```kotlin
override fun onCardTokenized(
	cardTokenizationData: CardTokenizationData,
	resumeCallback: ResumeCallback
) {
	val sale = OperationDto.Sale(
		amount = cardTokenizationData.tipAmount,
		currency = Currency.getInstance("EUR"),
		options = SaleOptions(/* additional config */)
	)
	resumeCallback.resume(sale)
}
```

---

**Sequence Diagram**

[![Cloud Tokenized SALE](/img/cloud_tokenized_Sale.png)](/img/cloud_tokenized_Sale.png)

---

**Summary**

The **Cloud Tokenized Operation** enables external services to initiate tokenized Sale transactions through a structured `CloudFinancialRequest`. The SDK handles card tokenization and executes the Sale transaction if the correct flags are set.

> **Tip:** This is ideal for headless or server-triggered flows that require secure card tokenization and transaction execution in a single interaction.


### Cloud Tokenized Sale Reversal

**Overview**

The **Sale Reversal Tokenized Operation** is a cloud-initiated process that tokenizes a card and performs a **Sale Reversal** transaction. This operation is triggered via a `CloudFinancialRequest` object and follows the same interaction pattern as other dependant tokenized operations.

It is identified by:

- `operation = Operations.SaleReversal`
- `tokenize = true`

Upon receiving this request, the SDK emits the **`Events.DependantReversalReceived`** event. The integrator is then responsible for controlling the transaction flow using the `ResumeDependantOperationExecutor` interface.

---

**CloudFinancialRequest Configuration**

**Required Fields**

| Field            | Value                            | Description                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `operation`      | `Operations.SaleReversal`        | Identifies a Sale Reversal request.         |
| `tokenize`     | `true`                           | Triggers tokenization before the operation. |

Other fields such as `originalTransactionId`, `currency`, `amount`, and `transactionReference` must also be set as needed.

---

**Event: `Events.DependantReversalReceived`**

Emitted when the SDK receives a cloud request for a **Sale Reversal** with tokenization enabled. The integrator handles this event via the `DependantOperationEvent` interface:

```kotlin
interface DependantOperationEvent {
	fun dependantRefundReceived(
		amount: BigInteger,
		currency: Currency,
		originalTransactionId: String,
		resumeDependantOperation: ResumeDependantOperation
	)

	fun dependantReversalReceived(
		originalTransactionId: String,
		resumeDependantOperation: ResumeDependantOperation
	)
}
```

---

**Interface: ResumeDependantOperationExecutor**

```kotlin
interface ResumeDependantOperationExecutor {
	fun executeDependantOperation(amount: BigInteger, currency: Currency, originalTransactionId: String)
	fun finishWithoutCardOperation()
	fun cancel()
}
```

---

**Implementation: ResumeDependantSaleReversalExecutorImpl**

```kotlin
class ResumeDependantSaleReversalExecutorImpl(
	private val currency: Currency,
	private val originalTransactionId: String,
	private val options: InternalSaleReversalOptions,
	private val delegate: Hapi
): ResumeDependantOperationExecutor {

	override fun executeDependantOperation(amount: BigInteger, currency: Currency, originalTransactionId: String) {
		val refundOperationDto = OperationDto.SaleReversal(
			amount,
			currency,
			originalTransactionId,
			options
		)
		val result = delegate.tokenizedOperation(currency, refundOperationDto, options).operationStarted
		if (!result) {
			val transactionResult = InstancesManager.transactionData.generateTransactionResultWithoutResponse()
			transactionResult.finStatus = FinancialStatus.FAILED
			transactionResult.transactionOrigin = TransactionOrigin.CLOUD
			sendTransactionResult(transactionResult)
		}
	}

	override fun finishWithoutCardOperation() {
		val transactionResult = InstancesManager.transactionData.generateTransactionResultWithoutResponse()
		transactionResult.finStatus = FinancialStatus.AUTHORISED
		transactionResult.type = TransactionType.VOID_SALE
		transactionResult.currency = currency
		transactionResult.totalAmount = BigInteger.ZERO
		transactionResult.transactionOrigin = TransactionOrigin.CLOUD
		transactionResult.transactionID = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
		transactionResult.eFTTransactionID = transactionResult.transactionID
		transactionResult.originalEFTTransactionID = originalTransactionId

		InstancesManager.cardReader.isCardPresent = true
		sendTransactionResult(transactionResult)
	}

	override fun cancel() {
		val transactionResult = InstancesManager.transactionData.generateTransactionResultWithoutResponse()
		transactionResult.finStatus = FinancialStatus.CANCELLED
		transactionResult.type = TransactionType.VOID_SALE
		transactionResult.currency = Currency.Unknown
		transactionResult.totalAmount = BigInteger.ZERO
		transactionResult.transactionOrigin = TransactionOrigin.CLOUD
		transactionResult.originalEFTTransactionID = originalTransactionId
		sendTransactionResult(transactionResult)
	}

	internal fun sendTransactionResult(transactionResult: TransactionResult) {
		TransactionResultHandler.transactionFinished(transactionResult)
	}
}
```

---

**Behavior and Flow**

| Method                          | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `executeDependantOperation(...)` | Executes the `SaleReversal` operation after tokenization. |
| `finishWithoutCardOperation()`   | Returns an `AUTHORISED` transaction result without financial movement. |
| `cancel()`                       | Sends a `CANCELLED` transaction result indicating cancellation. |

[![Standalone Tokenized Refund, Reversal and RefundReversal Sequence Diagram](/img/cloud_tokenized_SaleReversal.png)](/img/cloud_tokenized_SaleReversal.png)
---

**Summary**

The **Sale Reversal Tokenized Operation** is a secure, cloud-triggered flow for performing a **Sale Reversal** using a tokenized card. The operation is handled through the `DependantReversalReceived` event and executed with a `ResumeDependantOperationExecutor` implementation.

> **Tip:** Use `finishWithoutCardOperation()` when the sale reversal is already completed outside the SDK but you want to report it as authorised for consistency.


### Cloud Tokenized Refund

**Overview**

The **Refund Tokenized Operation** is a cloud-based flow that allows merchants to initiate a tokenized refund from a remote system. It uses the same `CloudFinancialRequest` object as other cloud operations.

This operation is identified by:
- `operation = Operations.Refund`
- `tokenize = true`

Upon receiving the request, the SDK emits the **`Events.DependantRefundReceived`** event. The integrator must handle this event by using the **`ResumeDependantOperationExecutor`** interface to define the next step.

---

**CloudFinancialRequest Configuration**

**Required Fields**

| Field            | Value                        | Description                             |
|------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `operation`      | `Operations.Refund`          | Indicates the refund operation.         |
| `tokenize`     | `true`                       | Enables card tokenization.              |

Other standard fields such as `amount`, `currency`, `originalTransactionId`, and `transactionReference` should be populated according to the use case.

---

**Event: `Events.DependantRefundReceived`**

Triggered when a tokenized refund request is received from the cloud. The integrator must respond using a `ResumeDependantOperationExecutor` implementation.

---

**Interface: ResumeDependantOperationExecutor**

Defines the actions the integrator must take after receiving the refund request.

**Behavior and Flow**

| Method                          | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `executeDependantOperation(...)` | Triggers the refund transaction using the provided amount, currency, and original transaction ID. |
| `finishWithoutCardOperation()`   | Sends a transaction result with `AUTHORISED` status but **without processing a refund** â used when the refund was completed outside the SDK. |
| `cancel()`                       | Sends a transaction result with `CANCELLED` status â used when the integrator cancels the operation. |

**Summary**

The **Refund Tokenized Operation** is a controlled cloud-based refund workflow that tokenizes the card and delegates control to the integrator for determining the refund outcome.

- Triggered via `CloudFinancialRequest` with `operation = Refund` and `tokenize = true`.
- Uses the `ResumeDependantOperationExecutor` interface to define the refund behavior.
- Provides flexibility to execute, authorize without refund, or cancel the transaction.

> **Tip:** Use `finishWithoutCardOperation()` when refund logic is handled outside the SDK and you only need to notify the POS system.


### Cloud Tokenized Refund Reversal

**Overview**

The **Refund Reversal Tokenized Operation** is a cloud-triggered operation that securely tokenizes a card and performs a **Refund Reversal**. This operation is initiated via a `CloudFinancialRequest` object with:

- `operation = Operations.RefundReversal`
- `tokenize = true`

After receiving the request, the SDK emits the **`Events.DependantReversalReceived`** event. The integrator must respond by using the **`ResumeDependantOperationExecutor`** interface to control how the operation proceeds.

---

**CloudFinancialRequest Configuration**

**Required Fields**

| Field            | Value                             | Description                                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `operation`      | `Operations.RefundReversal`       | Indicates the refund reversal operation.     |
| `tokenize`     | `true`                            | Enables card tokenization.                   |

Other standard fields such as `amount`, `currency`, `originalTransactionId`, and `transactionReference` should also be included.

---

**Event: `Events.DependantReversalReceived`**

This event is emitted after receiving a valid cloud request for a refund reversal. The integrator must implement `ResumeDependantOperationExecutor` to define the next action.

---

**Interface: ResumeDependantOperationExecutor**

```kotlin
interface ResumeDependantOperationExecutor {

	fun executeDependantOperation(
		amount: BigInteger,
		currency: Currency,
		originalTransactionId: String
	)

	fun finishWithoutCardOperation()

	fun cancel()
}
```

---

**Implementation: ResumeDependantRefundReversalExecutorImpl**

```kotlin
class ResumeDependantRefundReversalExecutorImpl(
	private val currency: Currency,
	private val originalTransactionId: String,
	private val options: InternalRefundReversalOptions,
	private val delegate: Hapi
): ResumeDependantOperationExecutor {

	override fun executeDependantOperation(amount: BigInteger, currency: Currency, originalTransactionId: String) {
		val refundOperationDto = OperationDto.RefundReversal(
			amount,
			currency,
			originalTransactionId,
			options
		)
		val result = delegate.tokenizedOperation(currency, refundOperationDto, options).operationStarted
		if (!result) {
			val transactionResult = InstancesManager.transactionData.generateTransactionResultWithoutResponse()
			transactionResult.finStatus = FinancialStatus.FAILED
			sendTransactionResult(transactionResult)
		}
	}

	override fun finishWithoutCardOperation() {
		val transactionResult = InstancesManager.transactionData.generateTransactionResultWithoutResponse()
		transactionResult.finStatus = FinancialStatus.AUTHORISED
		transactionResult.type = TransactionType.VOID_REFUND
		transactionResult.currency = currency
		transactionResult.totalAmount = BigInteger.ZERO
		transactionResult.transactionOrigin = TransactionOrigin.CLOUD
		transactionResult.transactionID = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
		transactionResult.eFTTransactionID = transactionResult.transactionID
		transactionResult.originalEFTTransactionID = originalTransactionId

		InstancesManager.cardReader.isCardPresent = true
		sendTransactionResult(transactionResult)
	}

	override fun cancel() {
		val transactionResult = InstancesManager.transactionData.generateTransactionResultWithoutResponse()
		transactionResult.finStatus = FinancialStatus.CANCELLED
		transactionResult.type = TransactionType.VOID_REFUND
		transactionResult.currency = Currency.Unknown
		transactionResult.totalAmount = BigInteger.ZERO
		transactionResult.transactionOrigin = TransactionOrigin.CLOUD
		transactionResult.originalEFTTransactionID = originalTransactionId
		sendTransactionResult(transactionResult)
	}

	internal fun sendTransactionResult(transactionResult: TransactionResult) {
		TransactionResultHandler.transactionFinished(transactionResult)
	}
}
```

**Behavior and Flow**

| Method                          | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `executeDependantOperation(...)` | Launches the `RefundReversal` operation after tokenization. |
| `finishWithoutCardOperation()`   | Sends an `AUTHORISED` transaction result without moving funds â used when reversal is handled externally. |
| `cancel()`                       | Sends a `CANCELLED` result indicating the integrator aborted the operation. |

**Summary**

The **Refund Reversal Tokenized Operation** is a cloud-driven flow designed to securely tokenize a card and optionally reverse a refund. It follows the same interaction pattern as other dependant cloud operations, with three possible paths controlled by the integrator:

- Execute the refund reversal.
- Acknowledge the transaction without refund movement.
- Cancel the operation entirely.

> **Tip:** Use this operation in cloud or headless setups where refunds need to be securely reversed with authorization logging.
