## 7.1004.2
**Features**:

Automatic Refunds. These new methods empowers users to seamlessly process refunds without the need for any physical card or card details.

- [Automatic Refund](androidtransactions.md#automatic-refund), users can effortlessly initiate a refund transaction without requiring the cardholder to dip, tap, or swipe their card.  Users only need to pass the Original Transaction ID (GUID) to the Automatic Refund function. The system will automatically process the refund, and the refunded amount will mirror the original sale amount, simplifying the entire refund process.


- [Automatic Partial Refunds](androidtransactions.md#automatic-partial-refund). This operation allows you to PARTIALLY refund a card automatically without requiring the cardholder to dip/tap/swipe his card. In its simplest form you only have to pass the amount, currency and the Original Transaction ID (GUID).


 By eliminating the need for physical card involvement, Automatic Refund streamlines the refund process, saving time for both merchants and customers. This efficiency boost enhances overall transaction management, contributing to a more seamless and customer-centric experience.


**Fixes**:

- Inconsistency when formatting currencies using Slovenian as the locale.


## 7.1004.1
**Features**:

We're excited to announce the latest update to our Android SDK, featuring support of Mastercard MoneySend fields for money remittance merchants. In order to use this functionality, we provide you with an object called [Money Remittance Options](androidobjects.md#money-remittance-options) which must be sent for all Mastercard transactions.

The supported operations are Sale, Sale & Tokenize, Refund, Linked Refunds, Reversals, MoTo Sale, MoTo Refund. For Linked Refunds and Reversals, Money Remittance fields should be taken from the original Sale/MoTo/Refund when using the field `originalTransactionID`.

***Please note**: Money Remittance is available only for some acquirers and geographies. Please check with your Handpoint relationship manager about the availability of this functionality for your merchants.

## 7.1004.0
**Features**:

We are introducing a new transaction type called [Pre-Authorization](androidtransactions.md#pre-auth). A pre-authorization charge, also known as a pre-auth or authorization hold, is a temporary hold placed on a customer's payment card. It's used to verify that the account is valid and has sufficient funds to cover a pending transaction, without actually debiting the cardholder's account upfront. 

A pre-authorized transaction can be increased or decreased ([Pre-Auth Increase](androidtransactions.md#pre-auth-increasedecrease)), for example if a tab was opened and the consumer is adding new orders going above the initial pre-authorized amount.  

A pre-authorized transaction can be captured ([Pre-Auth Capture](androidtransactions.md#pre-auth-capture)) to actually debit the cardholder's account. Depending on the merchant category code, the capture needs to happen between 7 and 31 days after the original pre-authorization. If not captured the funds will be automatically released by the issuing bank. 

A pre-authorized transaction can be fully released ([Pre-Auth Reversal](androidtransactions.md#pre-authcapture-reversal)), for example when renting a car, the pre-auth reversal allows the merchant to release the funds if the car was not damaged

We are also introducing the [Tokenize And Modify](androidtransactions.md#tokenize-and-modify) operation. A tokenize and modify operation allows you to start a financial operation for an initial amount, tokenize the card being dipped/tapped/swiped and modify the amount before the transaction is sent for processing. This feature allows you to bring your own loyalty engine and apply for example an instant discount at the point of sale for loyal customers.  


## 7.1002.0
**Features**:

We are introducing a new feature called [Get Transaction Status](androiddevicemanagement.md#getTransactionStatus). This new feature allows you to query the Handpoint Gateway for the status of a transaction at any given time. For example, in case of an app crash, timeout, or connection problem, you are now able to use the [transaction reference](androidobjects.md#OperationStartResult) returned at the start of a financial operation to get the status of a transaction in real time. You can use this feature to track the progress of your payments and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. This feature is available for all payment methods and currencies.

- Cloud integrations: A new parameter called `transactionReference` has been added to the [transactionStarted](androideventlisteners.md#transactionStarted) method. This means that when implementing this method in a class, you need to update the method signature to include the new parameter.

Added Estonian language ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª


## 7.1001.0
**Features**:

 We are introducing a new feature called [Transaction Metadata](androidobjects.md#metadata). This new feature helps the customer to persist and echo back some data that belongs to the customer business domain at transaction time. The Transaction Metadata is sent in the request and echoed back in the response from the gateway. In addition, customers will be able to use the Transaction Metadata to search matching transactions from our Transaction Feed API.*****

The Transaction Metadata feature will be available when the Handpoint Android SDK **v7.1001.0** or higher is used. 

***Please note**: Transactions will be available in TXN Feed API only if the request has reached the gateway.
