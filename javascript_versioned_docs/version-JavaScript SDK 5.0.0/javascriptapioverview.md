# API Overview

This API flow shows how easy it is to add card present payments to your cloud application. The interaction between your cloud application and the Handpoint JavaScript SDK is simple and streamlined. The Handpoint JavaScript SDK takes care of all of the communication with the terminal. The status messages are received in the WEB APP via the callback function defined in the Financial Operation requests call. Thatâ€™s it.

The Handpoint JavaScript SDK shields your software from all sensitive cardholder data. With Handpoint JavaScript SDK, the transaction request goes from your software to Handpoint in the cloud. We steer the terminal from the cloud. All of the results come to your software via Handpoint in the cloud.
